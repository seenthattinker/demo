Eligibility of Work for SR&ED Investment Tax Credits Policy
===========================================================


The main SR&ED website is [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program.html).




This is a replica of the government's website material.
Our notes are separated from the main text as follows.


This document clarifies what work constitutes scientific research and
experimental development (SR&ED). It is directed at personnel who
identify SR&ED work. Identifying SR&ED requires technical personnel who
performed, are familiar with, or are responsible for the work.

What is SR&ED?
------------------

### In our words

The way the government talks about the scientific research and experimental development grant/tax credit sounds a little bit like the encrypted language of 15th century alchemists.
It kind of sounds like a formula but it doesn't really add up to a formula.
There is no mathematical precision in applying for this tax credit.
The best way to think about it is as a story.


It's one of the oldest stories ever told.
It's the basis of a good percentage of our mythology and the cultural habit of storytelling.
It's everywhere,
from Homer in *The Odyssey* to Bruce Willis in *Die Hard*.
&mdash;
the hero's journey.
The twentieth century mythologist,
Joseph Campbell,
theorized that human beings wanted to live a heroic journey.
Even if we only live that journey through the exploits of others.
Campbell would have us believe that it's in our DNA.

Anyway,
it turns out the heroic journey and a SR&ED application have a lot in common.

### In their words


Scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) is defined for
income tax purposes in subsection 248(1) of the *Income Tax Act* &ndash; as
follows:

Scientific research and experimental development means systematic
investigation or search that is carried out in a field of science or
technology by means of experiment or analysis and that is:

- &ndash; basic research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of
scientific knowledge without a specific practical application in view,
- &ndash; applied research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of
scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view, or
- &ndash; experimental development, namely, work undertaken for the purpose of
achieving technological advancement for the purpose of creating new, or
improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including
incremental improvements thereto,
and, in applying this definition in respect of a taxpayer, includes
- &ndash; work undertaken by or on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to
engineering, design, operations research, mathematical analysis,
computer programming, data collection, testing or psychological
research, where the work is commensurate with the needs, and directly in
support, of work described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) that is
undertaken in Canada by or on behalf of the taxpayer,

but does not include work with respect to

- &ndash; market research or sales promotion
- &ndash; quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes
- &ndash;  research in the social sciences or the humanities
- &ndash; prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas
- &ndash; the commercial production of a new or improved material, device or product or the commercial use of a new or improved process
- &ndash; style changes, or
- &ndash; routine data collection.



![SRE&ED Overview](/assets/img/sred.svg)

What is generally understood to be *research and development*, or *R&D*,
is not necessarily *SR&ED*. SR&ED is carried out in a certain way and
for specific reasons. The definition of SR&ED describes how and why SR&ED work is carried out.




*Eligible* &ndash; and *ineligible* &ndash; (including the forms *eligibility* &ndash; and *ineligibility*) are widely used in the SR&ED program, although
the Act does not define these terms. For this document, *eligible* &ndash; or *ineligible*, without any other qualifier, means work that meets or does not meet
the definition of SR&ED in subsection 248(1) of the Act. In addition, *uncertainty* &ndash; and *advancement* &ndash; without any other qualifiers refer to scientific or
technological uncertainty and scientific or technological advancement respectively.





### How SR&ED is carried out

The definition of SR&ED describes **how** &ndash; SR&ED is performed—a
*[systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
that is carried out in a field
of [science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn)
or [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
by means of
[experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss).*

Most work, especially research and development, is carried out
systematically. It follows known design methods, techniques, procedures,
protocols, standards, and other practices. Also, in many situations,
problems are solved by following established procedures and standards.
In other words, a systematic approach is used to carry out work.

![how](/assets/img/how.svg)

It is important to distinguish between a systematic approach to carrying
out work and the approach that is a [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
called for in the definition of
[SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd).
The latter approach includes defining a problem, advancing
a [hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
towards resolving that problem, planning and testing the hypothesis by
[experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss),
and developing logical conclusions based on the results.

The [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
is common to all work, including scientific,
[engineering](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ngnrng)
or other development, that involves SR&ED. And, it is recognized that in
an industrial context, a *possible solution to the problem* &ndash; may be
considered a
[hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss),
and *building and testing of a prototype* &ndash; may be considered part of the
[experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss).

How the work is carried out is only one aspect of whether it is SR&ED.
Before it can be determined that work is SR&ED, consideration must also
be given to why the work was carried out.





### Why SR&ED is carried out

The definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
also describes **why** &ndash; SR&ED is undertaken—for the [advancement of
scientific
knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt),
or for the purpose of achieving [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
aimed at creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices,
products, or processes including incremental improvements.

The [systematic investigation or search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
carried out in a field
of [science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn)
or [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
by means
of [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
must be seeking [scientific or technological advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
for it to be SR&ED.

Work for the [advancement of scientific knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt) or
for the purpose of [technological advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
implies an attempt to resolve what is called [scientific uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty) or
[technological uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty). Basically,
the advancement is the targeted outcome of the SR&ED work while the uncertainty is the impetus for the SR&ED work. Therefore, an attempt to achieve
advancement is an attempt to resolve uncertainty.

![why](/assets/img/why.svg)


Work types
----------------


### Basic research

[Basic research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch)
is work undertaken for the [advancement of scientific knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
without a specific practical application in view. It is usually carried
out in a laboratory setting. Claims involving basic research sometimes
include [third-party payments](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#thrdpp)
to, for example, universities, research institutes, and consortia. The
results of basic research are usually published in scientific journals.

![Example] One example of [basic research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch) is
research in the field of elementary particles. This work had its origin as
a [hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
in theoretical physics or scientific models of the structure of matter. Originally there was no physical evidence that the hypothetical particles existed,
let alone that there could be a practical value to them. At some point, experiments were devised and performed that demonstrated that these particles
existed, and measured their properties (mass and charge). The electron was one of these discoveries.





### Applied research

[Applied research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch)
is also work undertaken for the [advancement of scientific knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt),
but with a specific practical application in view. Like [basic research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch),
the results could be published in scientific journals.

![Example] The discovery of the principle of the transistor, that is, the ability to control the conductivity of a semiconductor, can be considered an example of applied research. A private company did this particular work. Its research objective was to gain knowledge of the properties of semiconductors, particularly how electrons (one type of elementary particles that was discovered as a result of the basic research noted above) behaved in them. The company clearly hoped to develop a practical application (a semiconductor amplifier) based on the scientific knowledge gained although at this point no device or product had been made.





### Experimental development

[Experimental development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
is work undertaken for the purpose of achieving [technological advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials,
devices, products, or processes, including incremental improvements.

![Example] One example of [experimental development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
is the work that came about from the discovery of the principle of the
transistor. It resulted in the development of devices that used this
principle to create solid-state amplifiers and other devices. The
development
of [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
to make devices and eventually products using this discovery was done
through experimental development. The [applied
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch)
was rapidly followed by the development of
working [prototypes](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prttyp)
and eventually by practical techniques to make a new product—the
transistor. Developing a transistor after discovering the principle of
the transistor did not advance scientific knowledge. It did, however,
advance technology (the practical application of scientific knowledge
and principles).

![work](/assets/img/work.svg)





Methodology to determine if work meets the definition of SR&ED
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following two-step methodology can be used to determine if and to what extent work meets the definition of SR&ED:

1. Determine if there is SR&ED.

  - &ndash; In this step, the details of the work are examined to the point where the five questions can be answered.

1. Determine the extent of eligible work.

  - &ndash; In this step, the details of the work are examined to determine what work is SR&ED.





### Determine if there is SR&ED

Determining if there is SR&ED means showing that there is a [systematic investigation or search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
that is carried out in a field of [science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn)
or [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
by means of [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
and that is [basic research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch),
namely, work undertaken for the [advancement of scientific knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
without a specific practical application in view, [applied research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch),
namely, work undertaken for the [advancement of scientific knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
with a specific practical application in view, or [experimental development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt),
namely, work undertaken for the purpose of achieving [technological advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including incremental improvements
thereto,

![systemicInvestigation](/assets/img/systemicInvestigation.svg)

The method to establish this involves answering the following five questions:

1.  Was there a [scientific or a technological uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)?
2.  Did the effort involve
    formulating [hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
    specifically aimed at reducing or eliminating that uncertainty?
3.  Was the overall approach adopted consistent with a [systematic investigation or search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv),
    including formulating and testing the
    [hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
    by means of
    [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
    or
    [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)?
4.  Was the overall approach undertaken for the purpose of achieving a
    [scientific or a technological
    advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)?
5.  Was a record of the hypotheses tested and the results kept as the
    work progressed?


![systemicInvestigation](/assets/img/fiveQuestions.svg)



These questions follow the progression of SR&ED work from identifying
the uncertainty, through carrying out the work for its resolution, to
the resulting advancement. They are also interrelated, with question 1
and question 4 looking at why the work was done and questions 2, 3, and
5 looking at how the work was done. Because of the relationships between
the questions, the five questions should be considered jointly across
the entire body of work being evaluated.

There is SR&ED if the answer to each of the questions is yes.

With respect to the five preceding questions, consideration must be
given to the [scientific or technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl)
and the business environment of the individual company. Business
environment characteristics include business size, competition, area of
industry, and access to technical resources. It is expected that any
company making a claim for SR&ED will have or will access the expertise
necessary to carry out that work.







### Was there a scientific or a technological uncertainty?

[Scientific or technological uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty) whether a given result or objective can be achieved or how to achieve it, is not known or determined on the basis of generally available scientific or technological knowledge or experience. Specifically, it is uncertain if the goals can be achieved at all or what alternatives (for example, paths, routes, approaches, equipment configurations, system architectures, or circuit techniques) will enable the goals to be met based on the existing [scientific or technological knowledge base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl). There is [scientific uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty) in [basic research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch) or [applied research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch). There is [technological uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty) in [experimental development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt). Recognition of the uncertainty is an integral step in the [systematic investigation or search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv) and implies recognition of the need for advancement.
[Technological
uncertainties](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
may arise from shortcomings or limitations of the current state
of [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
that prevent a new or improved capability from being developed. In other
words, the current state of technology may be insufficient to resolve a
problem.







###  Example 1: Technological uncertainty





**Introduction**

Technological uncertainty may arise from limitations of the current
technology that prevent you from developing a new or improved
capability. Technological uncertainty exists when you don’t know whether
you can achieve a certain result or objective or how to achieve it based
on generally available scientific or technological knowledge or
experience.

We cannot determine eligibility without understanding the work performed
and evaluating it using the five questions. In this example, there are
indicators that suggest there is uncertainty but they do not point to
any specific uncertainty.

**Example**

You use the current technology to extract oil from oilseeds, which
involves batch processing. In batch processing, the seeds are crushed,
conditioned, and flaked at high temperature (80–100°C). The residue
after removing the oil is made up mostly of protein-rich flour and seed
coats with some trapped oil. This residue (also called meal) is then
ground and the trapped oil is extracted with solvent. The solvent is
recovered from both the meal and the extracted oil by toasting and
distillation. You generally sell the meal as an animal feed product.
However, it would be better if you could sell the meal as nutrition rich
flour.

The meal product you get with this process is a mixture of protein-rich
flour, which you want, and seed coats, which you don’t want. Seed coats
have no nutritional value, and they make the flour visually unappealing
as a potential ingredient in food for humans to consume. Also, the high
temperature used in the conditioning and flaking harms the nutritional
value of the oil and the flour. With the current technology, your
ability to separate the protein-rich flour from the seed coats without
affecting the nutritional value of the oil and flour is limited. You
want to develop a low-temperature oil extraction process that would let
you separate the protein-rich flour from the seed coats for a particular
type of oilseed, so you can produce a protein-rich product suitable for
humans to consume.

In particular, you want to be able to separate the seed coats from the
protein-rich flour at a low temperature. This is difficult because the
seed coats and the flour have similar physical properties and because
the two are bonded together.

Although there are many different methods to separate solid particles
with different physical properties, there is no effective
low-temperature method to separate solid particles with very similar
physical properties when the particles themselves are bonded together.

After literature review and discussing it with academic and industrial
experts, you found out that one technology that had reportedly been
tried to separate seed coats from flour on a small scale was ultrasonic
maceration (without extraction) in a batch process. But, you could not
find any information on using ultrasonic maceration with solvent
extraction for your particular oilseed. On top of that, you believed
that you needed to develop a continuous process for a large-scale
operation (as opposed to a small-scale batch process) that involved
ultrasonic maceration and simultaneous solvent extraction. There was no
information that showed whether large-scale ultrasonic maceration and
solvent extraction had been used for any type of oilseed. There was
technological uncertainty associated with developing a large-scale
continuous method using ultrasonic maceration and simultaneous solvent
extraction to process a particular type of oilseed at low temperatures
to produce a protein-rich product suitable for humans to consume. You
did not know whether you could achieve that or how to achieve it based
on generally available technological knowledge or experience. 

**Conclusion**

Technological uncertainty arose because of the limitations of current
technology. You could not use the current technology to develop a
large-scale, continuous process to separate the seed coats from the
protein-rich flour at a low temperature. There was technological
uncertainty because you did not know whether you could achieve a
specific result or objective or how to achieve it based on generally
available scientific or technological knowledge or experience.











It is important to recognize that this question relates to more than
simply identifying that how to achieve the objectives is unknown. One
must be able to identify specifically what is lacking in the [scientific
or technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl)
that is creating this
[uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).
This is necessary to formulate an appropriate
[hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
for further investigation.

In relation to a problem identified in creating new or improving
existing materials, devices, products, or processes, there might have
been some doubt concerning the way of solving it. This doubt could
have arisen from a technical problem or from a [technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty). It
is therefore important to understand the distinction between the two. In
the case of a technical problem, the existing [scientific or
technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl) is
sufficient to resolve the problem. Overcoming a technical problem will
not lead to a [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt),
although it may lead to the creation of a new or improved product or
process. On the other hand, in the case of a technological uncertainty,
the solution or the method of finding the solution to the problem is not
known based on the existing scientific or technological knowledge
base, and requires [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
to resolve the problem.







###  Example 2: Technical problem versus technological uncertainty





**Introduction**

There is a difference between a technical problem and a technological
uncertainty.

We cannot determine eligibility without understanding the work performed
and evaluating it using the five questions. In this example, there are
indicators that suggest there may be uncertainty but they do not point
to any specific uncertainty.

**Example**

**Scenario 1 – Technical problem**

You are a chemical company and you are developing a new process for a
chemical product. Part of the process involves a series of pumps. The
pumps started to corrode after six months, even though they had an
expected lifespan of 10 years. Surprised to see corrosion so soon, you
contacted the pump supplier. After looking at the pumps, the pump
supplier found that there was a corrosive liquid in them. The pumps were
not designed to come into regular contact with a corrosive liquid. So
you looked at your whole process, including the parts involving the
pumps. You found that there were low levels of a corrosive liquid in the
streams entering the pumps from time to time. After many weeks, you were
able to trace the source of the corrosive liquid back to a sporadic leak
in a filter system upstream of the pumps. You also found that the leak
was likely caused by the filter system operating at a higher temperature
than it was designed for. You replaced the filter system with a new
high-temperature filtration unit. This appears to have resolved the
problem of the corrosive liquid getting into the pumps. 

In this scenario, the problem with the pumps in the new process was
technical and not technological. You resolved the technical
problem—corroding pumps—by identifying the true source of the problem
and fixing it with an existing solution. 

**Scenario 2 – Technological uncertainty**

This time you are the pump supplier. A series of pumps supplied by you
started to corrode after six months of operation rather than after the
expected lifespan of 10 years. You were asked to investigate the
problem. You found that the pumps were corroding because of a leak in
the seal on their shaft, which allowed a corrosive liquid into the
units. In this case, the pumps were designed to operate in a corrosive
environment. You replaced the seals in the pumps, but the pumps again
showed signs of corrosion after six months. Again the cause was a leak
in the seal on their shaft.

You investigated further and found that the temperature of the shafts of
the pumps, after they had been working for a long time, was above the
maximum recommended operating temperature of the seal material. After
prolonged operation, the seal failed, letting corrosive liquid leak into
the units.

Once you discovered the cause of the problem, you started working on
understanding the relationship between the sealing material and the seal
profiles in a high-temperature, corrosive environment. You wanted to
figure out the most suitable seal profile and seal material to achieve a
10-year lifespan. The manufacturers had data on the behaviour and
physical properties of the seal materials at much lower temperature
ranges, but there was no information or data on their corrosion
resistance and physical properties at higher temperatures and in that
specific type of environment. Nor was there any information on the
profile that would be suitable for the high-temperature, corrosive
environment the pumps were going to be used in. 

In this scenario, you likely faced technological uncertainty which
prevented you from choosing a combination of seal profile and sealing
material that would offer long-term performance in a high-temperature,
corrosive environment. That technological uncertainty could be related
to the properties of the materials in the corrosive conditions as well
as to the effect of seal profile on performance.

**Conclusion**

There is a difference between a technological uncertainty and a
technical problem that can be resolved by applying practices,
techniques, or methodologies that are known or that are openly
available.











It is important to be able to differentiate [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
to resolve a [technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
from the use of known tools and techniques to solve a technical problem.
To this end, it is helpful to describe the work leading up to the
identification of the uncertainty. This will help establish (a) why the
uncertainty faced could not be resolved on the basis of generally
available scientific or technological knowledge or experience and (b)
the [scientific or technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tbslvl) of
the company.

Sometimes there is little doubt that a product or process can be
developed when cost targets are no barrier. In commercial reality,
however, a reasonable cost target is always an objective. Although such
cost targets on their own do not create [scientific or technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty),
trying to meet them might. For example, cost targets may require that
technologically uncertain paths be attempted, although more costly and
proven alternatives exist. A technological uncertainty may thus arise
that is imposed by economic considerations. Hence the existence of a
costly technologically certain alternative does not negate the
possibility that SR&ED work was performed to develop a product or a
process.







###  Example 3: Cost targets leading to technological uncertainty





**Introduction**

Even though a cost target in itself does not necessarily create a
technological uncertainty, a technological uncertainty might exist when
the paths to meeting the cost target are technologically uncertain. 

No specific technological uncertainty is identified in this example
because what is specifically lacking in the scientific or technological
knowledge base, which is preventing the cost target from being met, is
not explained.

We cannot determine the eligibility without understanding the work
performed and evaluating it using the five questions. In this example,
there are indicators that suggest there may be uncertainty but they do
not point to any specific uncertainty.

**Example**

You want to develop an air recirculation system for energy-efficient
homes that will permanently remove carbon monoxide. A key component of
this system is a module in which carbon monoxide is converted to
relatively harmless carbon dioxide at room temperature.

There is a process that uses a tin oxide and platinum catalyst to
convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide at room temperature. You could
develop a product that includes a module based on this process. However,
the high cost of using this process will make the selling price of the
product out of reach for your customers. There are other methods to
convert carbon monoxide, but they are not effective at room temperature.
It is important that the module operate at room temperature.

To achieve your project objective (a room-temperature carbon monoxide
remover), you have to develop a new inexpensive process. There might be
technological uncertainty associated with how to convert carbon monoxide
to carbon dioxide at room temperature without using the costly tin oxide
and platinum process.

**Conclusion**

Your motivation for doing the work is the cost target. The cost target—a
business or commercial objective—by itself does not create a
technological uncertainty. However, a technological uncertainty might
arise from the need to meet the cost target, even though a more costly
process is known to work.











Doubt about the business or commercial success of the material, device,
product, or process being developed is not a [scientific or
technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).

Furthermore, complexity does not necessarily mean the existence of
[technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).
The size and complexity of a project by itself does not justify that the
work performed in that project falls within the definition of
[SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd).
Likewise, the fact that a large and complex system was developed cannot
support the inference that an uncertainty existed. However, a form of
technological uncertainty called [system
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnc)
can arise from or during the integration of technologies, the components
of which are generally well known. This is due to unpredictable
interactions between the individual components or sub-systems. It may be
difficult or impossible to predict how the integrated system will
perform due to unforeseeable adverse interactions. The uncertainty here
is not in the individual modules or components, but in the modules or
components acting as an integrated system. The attempt to resolve these
uncertainties by a [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
can lead to [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).

By its nature,
[system uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnc) requires
that the technological specifications of the integrated system are such
that the underlying technologies of the sub-systems are unable to
achieve those specifications. Therefore, (some or all of) the underlying
technologies of the sub-systems would have to be changed.  It is
important to be able to distinguish between the work that is done to
advance the
underlying [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
of a sub-system that results in [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
and the work that does not require the underlying technology to be
advanced.

There is a difference between [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
work and development work.

Development work is based on the application of the existing [scientific
or technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty),
such as directly adapting a
known [engineering](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ngnrng)
or technological practice to a new situation, where there is reasonable
certainty of meeting the technological objectives. Under these
circumstances, there is no [technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).







###  Example 4: Development based on existing scientific or technological knowledge





**Introduction**

Development work is based on an existing scientific or technological
knowledge base. Specifically, you might be directly adapting a known
engineering or technological practice to a new situation when you are
reasonably certain that the known technology or practice will achieve
the desired objective.

We cannot determine eligibility without understanding the work performed
and evaluating it using the five questions. In this example, there are
indicators that suggest there may be uncertainty but they do not point
to any specific uncertainty.

**Example**

You are a greenhouse grower. After successfully verifying that a newly
developed plant variety can be grown in a small scale, you believe there
is a good chance you can use the new plant variety to produce commercial
crops. You are trying to find the optimum conditions to maximize
production.

You plant a controllable zone (between 2 and 10 acres) in a greenhouse
and monitor the growth of your crop. Depending on its performance, you
make adjustments to guide the crop to optimal production. These
adjustments involve using optimization techniques for variables such as
light, temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity. You also develop and
implement management protocols to optimize the control of nutrient
levels, de-leafing, thinning, and other operational practices. These
adjustments and management protocols are often called the *development
of cultural management strategies* &ndash; or *crop husbandry strategies.*

Based on the results from your controllable zone, you start commercial
production.

**Conclusion**

These strategies are well-known and practised in this industry. You are
fairly sure that the techniques, data, and procedures you used in this
case would work to optimize production. So, although you might not be
certain of the specific parameters, figuring them out using these
strategies is drawing on the existing scientific or technological
knowledge base of the industry. In this case, there is no scientific or
technological uncertainty in determining the optimum conditions to
maximize production of a new plant variety. This is development based on
the existing scientific or technological knowledge base.

In terms of SR&ED work, some elements of work may involve the
application of techniques, data, and procedures that are generally known
and available (for example, running an analytical test, which follows
standard protocols). When those elements of work are used to support
SR&ED work, they may be eligible.

Trouble-shooting is routinely correcting equipment, software, or
processes by identifying technical problems. The goals may be to resolve
software problems, optimize a process both technically and economically,
adjust equipment performance, evaluate it during breakdowns, improve
working conditions, minimize production losses, or control the
generation and/or disposal of waste. Trouble-shooting sometimes brings
out the need for SR&ED, but more often it involves detecting faults in
equipment or processes and results in changes to standard equipment
and/or processes without seeking to resolve uncertainties in the
underlying [science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn)
or
[technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy).
This type of detection and modification, on its own, is not SR&ED, even
though it is carried out systematically, because it does not seek to
resolve [scientific or technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).
On the other hand, trouble-shooting may be needed when SR&ED is carried
out, in which case it could be part of the eligible work for the
associated SR&ED project.





### Did the effort involve formulating hypotheses specifically aimed at reducing or eliminating that uncertainty?

Formulating
a [hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
designed to resolve the [scientific or technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
is an essential step and requires observing and understanding the
subject matter of the problem. Here, *hypothesis* &ndash; means an idea,
consistent with known facts, that serves as a starting point for further
investigation to prove or disprove that idea. The meaning of the term
hypothesis is applied in the most general sense and is sufficiently
broad to apply to an industrial context as well.





### Was the overall approach adopted consistent with a systematic investigation or search, including formulating and testing the hypotheses by means of experiment or analysis?

In SR&ED, it is expected that a planned approach is formulated; that is:

- &ndash; formulating one or
    more [hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
    designed to reduce or eliminate the
    [uncertainties](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty);
- &ndash; planning and executing the testing of the hypotheses
    by [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
    or [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss);
    and
- &ndash; developing logical conclusions based on the results or findings of
    the
    [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
    or
    [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss).

This means that the objectives of the SR&ED work, as well as the
indicators and measures to be used to determine if those objectives have
been met, must be clearly stated at an early stage in the work’s
evolution. In addition, the method of experimentation
or [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
by which the [scientific or technological
uncertainties](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
are to be addressed must be clearly set out. Finally, the results of the
SR&ED efforts that follow have to be properly identified. Often, this is
an iterative process as new uncertainties are recognized and new or
modified [hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
are developed and tested based on the results of the prior iteration.

Experimentation and
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
are approaches used to investigate
[hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss).
Experimentation involves structured and organized tests and studies to
obtain information in order to address the hypotheses. Experimenting
involves not only testing and analyzing but also exploring the
relationships between tests, explaining the results as they relate to
the hypothesis, drawing conclusions, proposing a new hypothesis, or
conducting additional tests. Such experimentation can include work on
the evolution
of [prototypes](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prttyp)
or models.

[Analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
is the detailed examination of information to differentiate the various
parts of a whole, determine their attributes, or explain their
relationships. It is performed against the background of available
knowledge and experience and it involves using tools such as models,
graphs, statistics, tables, diagrams, mathematical formulas, and
computer programs to express this knowledge or experience. Analysis is
an integral part of a [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv) and
it can be used to generate or test a
[hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss).

It is expected that the work will be performed or directed by [qualified
individuals](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfndv)
who are knowledgeable in the field and have relevant experience in
[science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn),
[technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy),
or
[engineering](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ngnrng).
Note that qualification is not necessarily limited to formal training,
but includes skills and knowledge gained through experience.

The need for a [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
does not preclude ideas that result from intuitive processes. These
ideas can lead
to [hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
for testing that are part of [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt).

Sometimes problems are solved by trial and error. Trial and error
involves executing a series of tests in no particular order and not part
of a systematic plan. The objective in such a case is to resolve a
functional problem rather than to address a problem in the
underlying [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
that may have caused this functional problem. The lesson learned in each
attempt of trial and error is simply that *an option did not work.*
There is no
further [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
of the reason why it did not work to make the lesson applicable in a
broader sense. The test conditions that are judged to be the most
effective in resolving the immediate problem are chosen for the next
attempt, and the process simply moves from attempt to attempt without
trying to understand or address the problem associated with the
underlying technology. Solving problems by trial and error is
not [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
within the framework of a [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv).





### Was the overall approach undertaken for the purpose of achieving a scientific or a technological advancement?

[Scientific or technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
is the generation of information or the discovery of knowledge that
advances the understanding of scientific relations or
[technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy).
One implication of advancement is that the new knowledge could be useful
to other situations or circumstances beyond the current project in which
the advance was made.

By showing why a possible solution will not succeed or will not meet the
desired objectives, [advancement in science or
technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
is still possible. In some instances, the project's objectives might not
have been achieved but, in the process, SR&ED was carried out to
understand the reasons for the failure. Hence, scientific or
technological advancement can be achieved even if the project’s
objectives are not met.

The rejection of
a [hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
is advancement because it eliminates a possible solution.

In [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt),
the work is carried out for the purpose of achieving [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
that, in turn, is for the purpose of creating new, or improving
existing, materials, devices, products, or processes. This means that
when a new or improved material, device, product, or process is created
as a result of SR&ED, it must embody a [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).
Hence, the technological advancement that is being sought is not the
same as the benefits of the new or improved material, device, product,
or process. Technological advancement moves the [scientific or
technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
of a company to a higher level through an increase in the understanding
of
[technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy).
In other words, it is a discovery or gain in understanding of
technological principles, techniques, and concepts beyond the existing
scientific or technological knowledge base.

The creation of new, or improvement of existing, materials, devices,
products, or processes can be achieved without [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).
Also, novelty, innovation, uniqueness, feature enhancement, or increased
functionality alone does not represent or establish technological
advancement. Instead, it is how these attributes or features arise (that
is, whether or not they arise through technological advancement) that is
important.







###  Example 5: Creating new materials, devices, products or processes without technological advancement





**Introduction**

The creation of new materials, devices, products, or processes, or the
improvement of existing ones, can be achieved without technological
advancement.

Work can be done systematically to produce a new product. However,
without technological uncertainty and an attempt to achieve
technological advancement, the work is not SR&ED.

We cannot determine eligibility without understanding the work performed
and evaluating it using the five questions.

**Example**

The basic design of the potato peeler has not changed for more than 100
years. You wanted to develop a novel peeler by adding a phosphorescent
substance to the plastic handle so it would be easier to find the peeler
in a dark kitchen drawer.

You obtained several samples of phosphorescent powders from various
suppliers. You carried out a number of production runs, testing each
powder at varying levels in the molding process. Adding the
phosphorescent substance did not require any change to the molding
process or the type of plastic, nor did it affect the other physical
properties of the handle or how the peeler worked. As a result of the
work you performed, you determined, for each powder, the amount needed
to produce the proper glow in the handle. You then chose a supplier
based on an analysis of the amount of powder needed and the unit cost of
the powder.

You came up with a new and novel product, and the work you performed to
choose the appropriate powder, based on performance and cost, was
carried out very systematically. However, there was no technological
advancement required to develop this glow-in-the-dark peeler.

There was no technological uncertainty. You could claim you were unsure
about how to achieve your objectives because you did not know which
powder to use and what level you needed to use it at to make the peeler.
However, there are no lacking scientific or technological knowledge or
principles that prevented you from making that determination. You knew
how to add the phosphorescent substance and adding it did not affect the
properties of the handle or the performance of the peeler.

**Conclusion**

New or improved materials, devices, products, and processes can be
developed without a technological advancement.











The success, failure, marketability, or commercial significance of work
is not relevant to its eligibility.

Process optimization and cost reduction are examples of process
development efforts with the objectives of improved efficiencies, better
output quality, or financial or strategic advantages. These developments
are represented, for example, by the functions of industrial
engineering, time and motion analysis, methods engineering, value
analysis and engineering, and tool and machine design. These
developments result in trends towards optimal conditions–improving the
material, device, product, or process. Most often they are conducted
based on the existing [scientific or technological knowledge
base](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty).
As identified in Section 2.1.1 there is a difference
between [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
work to advance the scientific or technological knowledge base and
development work based on the application of the existing scientific or
technological knowledge base.





### Was a record of the hypotheses tested and the results kept as the work progressed?

A record of the
[hypotheses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss),
tests and results should be kept as the work progresses.

It is expected that the work be recorded, clearly showing why each major
element is required and how each fits into the project as a whole. It is
also expected that the indicators or measures that will be used to
determine if the goals of the work are met will be identified and
recorded at an early stage of the work.

As part of the [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv),
the progression of work is built on analyzing results from step to step.
To build on the results of testing in a systematic way requires the
organized recording of the work undertaken during
[experimentation](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss).
This is a basis for being able to capture, communicate, and, if
necessary, repeat the work leading to the [advancement of scientific
knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
or the [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).

It is important to note that this question pertains only to records that
are naturally produced during the performance of SR&ED and simply
expresses that a systematic investigation generally cannot be carried
out without recording the work as it progresses. It is not suggestive of
the types of information to support an SR&ED claim. Please refer to
Appendix 2 of the latest version of the [T4088 Guide to Form T661
Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Expenditure
Claim](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4088.html)
for information on documentation and other evidence to support an SR&ED
claim.





### Step 2: Determine the extent of eligible work

The method used to assess whether there is SR&ED is described in
[section
2.1](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/eligibility-work-investment-tax-credits.html#s2_1).
This method, however, does not identify the extent of the SR&ED work.

The definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
in the Act helps determine the extent of the SR&ED work by
including [support
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk)
and excluding some other types of work.

Specifically, the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
states:

*and, in applying this definition in respect of a taxpayer, includes

The following sections provide additional details on how to determine
the extent of SR&ED work based on the definition of SR&ED in the Act.





### Support work

The work identified in paragraph (d) of the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
is usually referred to as [support
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk).
Work with respect to the eight categories listed in paragraph (d) does
not constitute SR&ED on its own. However, if it is [commensurate with
the
needs](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#cmmnsrt)
and [directly in
support](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprt)
of [basic
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch), [applied
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch),
or [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
work undertaken [in
Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncnd),
it falls within the meaning of SR&ED.

[Support
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk)
must be the following:
- &ndash; It must be [commensurate with the
    needs](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#cmmnsrt)
    of the [basic
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch),
    [applied
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch),
    or [experimental
    development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
    work undertaken in Canada. In other words, it must be corresponding
    in the amount, size, extent, or duration of work that is necessary
    to carry out [basic
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch),
    [applied
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch),
    or [experimental
    development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt) work
    undertaken in Canada.
- &ndash; It must be [directly in
    support](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprt)
    of the [basic
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch),
    [applied
    research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch),
    or [experimental
    development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
    work undertaken in Canada. That is to say, the work was carried out
    specifically to perform the related basic research, applied
    research, or experimental development work undertaken in Canada.

It must be with respect to one of the eight categories of work following:
    - &ndash; [engineering](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ngnrng)
    - &ndash; [design](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dsgn)
    - &ndash; [operations research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prtns)
    - &ndash; [mathematical analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#mthmtcl)
    - &ndash; [computer programming](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#cmptr)
    - &ndash; [data collection](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dtcllctn)
    - &ndash; [testing](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tstng)
        or
    - &ndash; [psychological research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#psycrsrch).







###  Example 6: Commensurate with the needs and directly in support





**Introduction**

Only the amount, size, extent, or duration of work that is necessary for
and directly in support of the basic research, applied research, or
experimental development work undertaken in Canada is eligible.

The work below includes a production run to produce a product for
testing. The context of the production run is not dealt with in this
example.

We cannot determine eligibility without understanding the work performed
and evaluating it using the five questions.

**Example**

You produce field hockey sticks in large numbers for the world market.
The main element of the production stage is a machine that accepts
pre-cut lengths of timber and produces the cut forms for further
processing, which includes rasping, curing, and finishing.

You started a project involving experimental development. You wanted to
integrate an advanced scanning and laser cutting technology to cut and
rasp hockey sticks into one machine instead of having two separate
machines. This integration step involved collecting data including size
and other tolerances and testing for mechanical strengths and other
performance requirements. Based on statistical analysis and your
in-house knowledge of the existing machinery, you determined that an
experimental sample size of 500 sticks from the cutting and rasping
machine would generate enough data to test and validate your hypotheses
with 95% confidence. It would also be enough to conclude that the
development is complete and successful.

You produced 2,000 sticks.

**Conclusion**

The testing and data collection associated with cutting and rasping the
first 500 sticks is commensurate with the needs and directly in support
of your SR&ED work. (Note that this is all this example deals with. It
does not deal with treating expenditures, including materials, for SR&ED
investment tax credits.)











### Excluded work

The work identified in paragraphs (e) to (k) of the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
is typically referred to as [excluded
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xcldd)
and, collectively, these paragraphs are referred to as the exclusions.
This work is not SR&ED. These exclusions identify work that, although
might be seen as enabling an SR&ED project to be carried out in some
manner, represents work that cannot be claimed for SR&ED tax credits.

It is important to realize that consideration is given to the exclusions
only after it has been determined that there is SR&ED. The exclusions
generally do not apply to the overall SR&ED. Rather, only after it has
been determined that there is SR&ED; the exclusions help to delineate
work that is included in the meaning of SR&ED, and work that is not. For
example, a project is not excluded because it involves [prospecting for
minerals](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#prspct).
However, if SR&ED is identified, the work with respect to prospecting
for minerals is not included in the SR&ED.

It can be difficult to differentiate between the SR&ED work that is
carried out in conjunction with non-SR&ED work. Where paragraphs (d) and
(e) through (k) are particularly helpful is in defining the boundary (or
to differentiate) between SR&ED work and that other work.

The key feature that distinguishes between [support
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprtwrk)
and [excluded
work](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xcldd)
is purpose. Why was the work done—was it done to support [basic
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch), [applied
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch)
or [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt),
or was it done for some other reason?





SR&ED project
-----------------

[Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED)
Expenditures Claim](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t661.html),
requires SR&ED work to be claimed as SR&ED projects. As a result,
claimants should be aware of the meaning of *project* &ndash; in the context of
SR&ED.





### Characteristics of an SR&ED project

Every project claimed must fall within the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
in subsection 248(1) of the Act. An SR&ED project is defined as a
project comprising a set of interrelated activities that:

- &ndash; collectively are necessary in attempting to achieve the
    specific [scientific or technological
    advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
    defined for the project by overcoming [scientific or technological
    uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty);
    and
- &ndash; are pursued through a [systematic investigation or
    search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
    in a field
    of [science](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#scn)
    or [technology](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#tchnlgy)
    by means
    of [experiment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
    or
    [analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
    performed by [qualified
    individuals](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#qlfndv).

Whether the work claimed meets the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
in subsection 248(1) of the Act is determined solely by examining the
nature and characteristics of the work itself. In other words, it is not
the overall commercial objective but rather what is actually occurring
at a technical level that is relevant. The key point is whether the work
has the characteristics to meet the definition of SR&ED, and not the
overall goals in a commercial sense. The SR&ED project's success or
failure in terms of meeting its overall commercial goals is not a factor
in determining its eligibility for investment tax credits.

It must first be determined whether there is SR&ED within the project.
If there is SR&ED, the next step is to assess the extent of the work and the associated expenditures against the objectives of
the SR&ED project.

The SR&ED project definition is not intended to support dividing a
correctly identified SR&ED project into smaller, and possibly
ineligible, activities. At a detailed level and by itself, the work may
appear routine. Projects should be identified at a level where all the
effort captured by the project falls within the definition of
[SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd).
This requires that appropriate internal procedures and accounting
methods are in place and sufficient to link the work and associated
expenditures to the project.





### Company project versus SR&ED project

A distinction must be drawn between a company project and an SR&ED
project. *Company project* &ndash; is a generic term referring to undertakings
by a company to have an impact on its business; for example, building
new facilities or expanding facilities, developing new products and
product lines, changing business practices, upgrading processes and
facilities, and engineering projects. A company project is a project
with a commercial purpose, whereas the purpose of an SR&ED project
is for the [advancement of scientific
knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
or for achieving [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).
Paragraph (c) of the definition
of [SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd)
recognizes, and in fact requires, that the [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
be done for the purpose of achieving technological advancement in the
context of creating new or improved materials, devices, products or
processes.

An SR&ED project usually occurs as a subset of a company project.
Therefore, not all of the work performed within a company project will
necessarily fall within the scope of the SR&ED project. Also, it is
possible that the same company project contains one or more SR&ED
projects, some of which may involve [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
and some of which may involve [basic
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch)
or [applied
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch).





### Duration of an SR&ED project

The start of the SR&ED project is identified as the point at which
the [scientific or technological
uncertainties](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
are identified, resulting in the definition of scientific or
technological objectives, as opposed to business or commercial
objectives. Work that is conducted as part of standard business practice
and is not needed to define the scientific or technological objectives
is not part of the SR&ED project.

It is recognized that once a [scientific or technological
uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
is identified, work may be required before
the [hypothesis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#hypthss)
is tested (that is,
before [experimentation](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
begins). Such work may fall within the meaning of
[SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd).
For example, a technical feasibility study could be eligible only if
followed-up
with [experimentation](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xprmnt)
or
[analysis](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#nlyss)
to test a hypothesis. This type of study must be distinguished from all
other types of studies (marketing, commercial, and financial), which are
not eligible as SR&ED.

The duration of an SR&ED project is not a factor in determining whether
the work performed meets the definition of
[SR&ED](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#srd).
Some projects are short—carried out fully within the tax year—while
other projects extend over several tax years. As an SR&ED project can
span a number of years, a snapshot of the work in a given year may not
reflect the overall effort to achieve the [advancement of scientific
knowledge](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
or [technological
advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt).
Once an SR&ED project has started, work in any year that
is [commensurate with the
needs](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#cmmnsrt)
of and [directly in
support](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#spprt)
of the attempt to achieve a scientific or technological advancement is
considered part of the SR&ED project.

The SR&ED project is complete when either
the [advancement](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#dvncmnt)
has been achieved and the
associated [uncertainty](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty)
resolved or when it is determined that the uncertainty cannot be
resolved. Commercialization or certification might not necessarily mean
that the SR&ED project is complete. Neither financial indicators (such
as first sale) nor issuing warranties alone are enough to mark the end
of an SR&ED project.

However, work generally associated with trouble-shooting, debugging, and
fine-tuning when there is no need to resolve [technological
uncertainties](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ncrtnty),
is not SR&ED work. Furthermore, work carried out when the product or
process is installed or implemented at the customer’s facility or
testing in an end-user’s environment ([beta site
testing](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bt))
to ensure that all technical specifications agreed upon with the
customer have been met is also not SR&ED work. Whether or not SR&ED work
continues into these stages of a project depends on the continued
presence of a technological uncertainty (or a new uncertainty arising)
and the [systematic investigation or
search](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#systmnv)
undertaken to resolve it.





SR&ED in a production or manufacturing environment
------------------------------------------------------

SR&ED in a production or manufacturing environment is referred to as
*shop floor SR&ED.* &ndash; It occurs in a variety of industry sectors and is
mostly [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt)
in nature. However, [basic
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#bscrsrch)
and [applied
research](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#ppldrsrch)
can also occur in a shop floor environment.

SR&ED, especially [experimental
development](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#xpdvlpmnt),
in a shop floor environment is generally not carried out in isolation.
Rather, it is performed with other non-SR&ED work. For example, SR&ED
can be carried out:

- &ndash; at the same location where other work is being performed
- &ndash; by staff performing their regular duties; or
- &ndash; while building or operating commercial equipment or facilities.

Shop floor SR&ED usually occurs when SR&ED is carried out in conjunction
or simultaneously with excluded commercial work. Paragraph (i) of the
definition of SR&ED specifically excludes work with respect to
the [commercial
production](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/glossary.html#cmmprd)
of a new or improved material, device, or product or the commercial use
of a new or improved process. Therefore, it is important to be able to
distinguish between the SR&ED work and other non-SR&ED work so that the
project costs can be allocated accordingly.

There are two situations that are commonly encountered that may involve
both SR&ED and non-SR&ED work—(1) SR&ED while developing an asset and
(2) SR&ED during production runs. The following two documents explain
how to isolate SR&ED work and the associated expenditures in these two
situations:

1.  [SR&ED while Developing an Asset
    Policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/while-developing-asset.html)
    – An asset is a thing or item that has some value to the company.
    When an asset (a material, device, product, or process facility)
    results from, or is developed for, SR&ED work; consideration must be
    given to what aspects of the development of the asset to include as
    SR&ED work.
2.  [SR&ED During Production Runs
