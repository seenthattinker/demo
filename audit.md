SR&ED Technical Audit Pointers
======================================





To help you be better prepared for an SR&ED audit by CRA,
explain the process,
minimize surprises,
and to maximize your ability to defend your claims,
we strongly recommend you understand the process.


Who Conducts The Audit
--------------------------------


Technical audits are performed by a Research and Technology Advisor (RTA)
&mdash;
usually highly trained and educated themselves.
Most RTAs have an engineering or science background,
with private sector work experience.
The CRA tries to match your claim
&mdash;
based on the field of science
&mdash;
with an RTA’s training and experience.

RTAs are often accompanied by a Financial Reviewer (FR).
The RTA sets the agenda and tone of the audit.
The FR takes their cues from the RTA.

An RTA-in-training may also be accompanied by a more experienced RTA.


Audit Process
-----------------



The audit process has been codified by CRA in a lengthy manual used by all RTAs as of June 2010.
This 166-page document is called [Claim Review Manual for Research and Technology Advisors](www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/pblctns/ntr-tchrvw-eng.html).

An edited version is available for taxpayers. [The SR&ED Technical Review: A Guide for Claimants](www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/pblctns/tchrvw-cmmnt-eng.html).

RTAs are now required to follow this somewhat rigid process,
leaving little flexibility.

Before the Audit
---------------------

Everyone from the company who plans to attend the audit must read the project reports beforehand.
Technical staff should be prepared to briefly summarize,
for each project,
and in their own words,
the following things:

1. Technological Advancements (Lessons Learned)
1. Technological Uncertainties
1. Systematic Experimental or Analytical Methodology

Organize the supporting documentation and have it handy in the meeting room.
Plan to have lunch brought in during the audit.
Confirm the schedule with auditor.
Plan for an all-day meeting.
Confirm the schedule with auditor beforehand.


During the Audit — Preliminaries
-----------------------------------------

This is generally not a hostile process.
Everyone should be relaxed,
friendly and confident.

Don’t give the auditor the impression that you have somewhere else to be.
Attendees must be prepared for a potentially lengthy meeting.
Try your best not to express impatience.

That being said,
personnel may need to rotate in and out of the meeting because of other commitments throughout the day.
This is fine,
so long as the people answering technical questions are available when the auditor needs them.

Assume that the auditor will be chairing the meeting.
Let them set the agenda,
but you can let them know you have a presentation and tour planned.

The auditor will very likely have an educational presentation regarding the SR&ED program.
He or she may go into *Teaching Mode* about R&D.
This is part of their job.

Have a brief presentation about your company ready to go.
If the corporate structure includes a foreign parent,
be very clear that the R&D activities you are claiming took place in Canada.

Introduce your technical staff.
Emphasize their qualifications.
Offer a plant tour.
Highlight any on-going R&D,
for example,
a product development lab,
or something like this.

If the auditor offers technical advice,
even if it’s their first visit to your site,
accept it gracefully.
They’re not telling you how to do your job.
They may simply be fascinated by the work you do.

When you reconvene,
let the auditor dictate the next step.


During the Audit — Questions about Specific Projects or Costs
---------------------------------------------------------------------


The RTA may wish to examine every project in detail,
or they may wish to focus on one or two projects.
Occasionally,
they will be satisfied with the tour alone,
but don’t depend on this.

Be prepared to defend every project.


Listen carefully to what the auditor is asking.
Your responses should be short,
sweet and on topic.

Take ownership of the reports.
Use them as guides regarding advances,
uncertainties,
and methodology.

These are your words. We’ve just summarized them.


Be prepared to state the following in your own words for each project:

#### The Advancement

For example, we were seeking to improve process efficiency and increase operator safety by eliminating airborne toxins.

#### The Uncertainties

There was no clearly defined way of accomplishing this goal. First, there was no ready-made solution available. Second, a number of alternative paths had
to be evaluated, for example, liquid vs. powder, barrier, vacuum. And lastly, even if we implemented any of these alternatives, the results weren’t
guaranteed.

#### What Was Done/What Was Learned

Liquids proved unfeasible. Built and tested a prototype barrier. Experimented with inlet sizes. Implemented a vacuum system. Designed a customized *de-clumper*. After all this, we failed to realize the goal because a full-scale test showed that efficiency actually decreased.

Emphasize analysis,
experimentation,
prototyping,
testing,
and new knowledge gained
&mdash;
these are the elements of a qualifying SR&ED project.

Have a piece of supporting documentation in mind, so that if asked, you can get to it quickly.

Use statements like *systematic investigation/experimentation*,
but not *trial and error*.

Don’t back down if the auditor challenges a project.
Defend it politely.
Interject politely,
respectfully to correct any inaccurate statement made by the auditor.

Common Challenges and Defense Strategies
--------------------------------------------


RTAs often want to disallow a project on the grounds that it was *routine engineering*.
The best defense is to demonstrate that the challenges or uncertainties you faced,
however slight,
could not be overcome using standard practice in your industry.
By definition,
if you could not solve the problem through the application of standard methods,
but rather had to resort to experimentation or analysis,
then you are doing eligible SR&ED.

It is vital to present evidence that some form of experimentation or analysis took place,
for example,
dated test results,
emails,
reports,
photos,
videos,
and things like this.

Another common challenge involves the scope of eligible SR&ED within a larger R&D projects.
SR&ED only starts after the First Uncertainty (FU) is encountered.
RTAs sometimes try to peg the FU as the point of *first failure*,
which often occurs well after an R&D project starts,
and therefore limits the amount of eligible costs.
To counter this challenge,
you must do your best to establish the FU as early as possible.
Uncertainties likely existed from the outset.
Try to provide documentation in any form that supports this assertion,
for example,
technology or literature surveys,
previous failures,
expert opinion,
and things like this.

RTAs may at first dismiss your arguments by making an incorrect assumption that *this is common knowledge*.
If so,
correct this mistake.


RTAs sometimes question the technical qualifications of the people doing the work,
especially if senior management is being claimed.
Anyone on the claim must have played a technical role,
either directly doing or supervising the experimental work.

Similarly,
the use of material and capital equipment
&mdash;
although these are cost related issues
&mdash;
are sometimes challenged by the RTA.

![Attention] Have documentation ready to counteract any such challenges.


SR&ED Support Activities
----------------------------


Work with respect to support work, the eight categories listed in paragraph do not
constitute SR&ED on their own. However, if it is commensurate with the needs and directly
in support of basic research, applied research, or experimental development work
undertaken in Canada, it falls within the meaning of SR&ED.


Support work must be the following:
It must be commensurate with the needs of the basic research, applied research, or
experimental development work undertaken in Canada. In other words, it must be
corresponding in the amount, size, extent, or duration of work that is necessary to carry out
basic research, applied research, or experimental development work undertaken in
Canada.


It must be directly in support of the basic research, applied research, or experimental
development work undertaken in Canada. That is to say, the work was carried out
specifically to perform the related basic research, applied research, or experimental
development work undertaken in Canada.


It must be with respect to one of the eight categories of work listed below

- engineering;
- design;
- operations research;
- mathematical analysis;
- computer programming;
- data collection;
- testing; or
- psychological research.



### Excluded Activities



The definition is broad-ranging,
and it can apply to many different types of businesses,
but the law specifically excludes certain activities from SR&ED tax incentives.
Among the activities that don’t qualify are:

- market research you do before you start your project
- promotions
- social science research projects
- humanities research projects
- and style changes.

You also may not count routine tasks such as testing,
quality control,
data collection,
commercial
production activities,
or commercial use of your new and improved products or ideas.

### Additional Audit Pointers


Emphasize and Avoid


Systematic approach
&mdash;
planned ahead of time,
conducted by qualified staff,
trial and error,
experimentation,
analysis,
testing,
prototyping,
and the like.


Routing Software Development
--------------------------------------------

### Experimental Development


Things at the technological Level:

- throughput
- speed
- response time
- technological risks & constraints
- limited bandwidth
- limited computing power
- repeatability
- reliability
- bug fixes
- coding
- and engineering are actually support activities.

Things at the functional Level:

- what the code does
- Programmatic risk
- business risk
- marketing risk
- too costly
- too complicated
- not enough time
- advancement in functionality feature extensions.

The earliest possible moment when the uncertainty was recognized
&mdash;
ideally from the outset of the project.
The stoic engineer recognition that not everything is SR&ED.
Every single thing in the project was SR&ED.

Conclusion
---------------------

1. Auditor should tell you his/her intention for each project before they leave, but with the new audit procedure and manual, this is not always the case.

2. All is not lost if auditor has a problem. They may just want additional supporting docs.

3. You should receive a written report within a couple of weeks.

4. If you believe the auditor has been truly unfair, there is an appeal process, although it should rarely come to that.


### Common Misconceptions


New product development, by itself, is always eligible. Wrong.


1. Not if achievable entirely through standard practice. Engineering, design and programming constitute SR&ED.
1. Not unless they support eligible experimental development. Projects qualify if they’re time-consuming, costly, complex, or difficult.
1. These things are irrelevant unless all three eligibility criteria are met. Uncertainties related to budget, scheduling, marketing, and the like, matter.
1. Not unless they lead to at least one technological uncertainty, novelty, innovation or uniqueness &mdash; *first of its kind* &mdash; always demonstrates a technological advancement.
1. Because these are not necessarily the outcome of experimental development.
