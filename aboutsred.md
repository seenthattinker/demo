### Donâ€™t Be Frustrated With the Complexity of Applying for SR&ED

Business owners tell us they want to get as much of their R&D reimbursed from the CRA as possible, but find it difficult to submit tax claims that stand up to the scrutiny of the CRA. Many companies have had a bad experience with SR&ED consulting firms who have filed a claim on their behalf.

#### Being passed around

It's frustrating when consulting firms pass you around from one person to the next, resulting in more work for you.
