### Don’t Be Frustrated With the Complexity of Applying for SR&ED

Business owners tell us they want to get as much of their R&D reimbursed from the CRA as possible, but find it difficult to submit tax claims that stand up to the scrutiny of the CRA. Many companies have had a bad experience with SR&ED consulting firms who have filed a claim on their behalf.

#### Being passed around

It's frustrating when consulting firms pass you around from one person to the next, resulting in more work for you.


#### Having to do the heavy lifting

SR&ED consulting firms may want your team to create the technical project description and prepare all documentation.


#### No IT or software experience


SR&ED consultants often find it hard to identify what fits the definition of SR&ED. There is a shortage of experienced consultants.

### Us

We are a full-service SR&ED Consulting Firm specialized in the software industry.
We engage with you to assess the technical and financial viability and make sure your claim gets approved by CRA with minimal audit risk.
Unlike larger SR&ED consulting firms, we offer full service from an individual consultant who gets to know your team and fully manages your CRA claim.
